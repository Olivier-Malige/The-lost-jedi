## Service the WebSocket transport from inside a long synchronous handler
## (an "exclusive run" — the test runner). The editor main thread is
## blocked, so `_process` cannot poll; without this the server keepalive
## (20s ping interval / 20s timeout) closes the session mid-run. See
## docs/test-run-transport-starvation-plan.md.
##
## Contract — do NOT extend this method to dispatch:
## - `WebSocketPeer.poll()` has no heartbeat-only mode; it also buffers
##   application frames. Buffering them past this call would replay them
##   STALE after their server-side futures expire (the #712 hazard), so
##   every drained command frame is REJECTED immediately with a retryable
##   EDITOR_NOT_READY / EDITOR_TEST_RUNNING error instead.
## - Drains to quiescence: poll → drain everything available → poll again,
##   until no packets remain. A full packet queue could hide a ping deeper
##   in the TCP stream, so nothing may spill to a later checkpoint.
## - `run_state` is caller-owned mutable state carrying the cumulative
##   packet counter under "packets_serviced" — no connection-global
##   lifecycle that could leak if the run dies.
