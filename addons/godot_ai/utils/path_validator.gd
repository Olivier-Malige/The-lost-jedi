## Validates `res://`-rooted paths against directory-traversal escape.
##
## Issue #347 (audit-v2 #3): handlers were accepting `res://../etc/passwd.gd`
## because the only check was `path.begins_with("res://")`. LLM-driven path
## generation (prompt injection, agent typos, untrusted issue/PR text in
## context) can produce traversal payloads for the write tools that produce
## arbitrary disk content (`script_create`, `filesystem_write_text`,
## `patch_script`) and for the matching reads (info disclosure surface).
##
## Two entry points:
##   * `validate_resource_path` — for paths that name a `res://` disk file the
##     plugin will read or (with `for_write`) write. This is the strict one.
##   * `validate_loadable_path` — for paths handed to `ResourceLoader`, which
##     also accepts `uid://` (an opaque resource-DB id that cannot express
##     traversal) and `user://` (the per-project user data sandbox). Load
##     handlers must use this so `uid://` references copied out of `.tscn`
##     ExtResource / `.uid` sidecars and `user://` runtime assets keep loading.
##
## Error wrapping: callers should use `path_error` / `loadable_error`, which
## return a ready `ErrorCodes.make(VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE, …)` dict (or null). A
## bad path is a value-domain error, and funneling every site through one
## wrapper keeps the error code consistent across all handlers.
##
## Known limitation: containment is lexical (`globalize_path` + `simplify_path`
## prefix match). It does NOT resolve symlinks — GDScript exposes no realpath.
## A symlink *inside* the project that points outside it can therefore defeat
## the under-root check. This matches the engine's own `res://` resolution and
## is accepted; the loopback trust boundary is the primary control.


# Cached project / user roots. `globalize_path` is stable across the editor's
# lifetime — caching avoids redundant resolution on every call. Matters most
# for `reimport`, which loops the validator over each path in a batch.
# Lazy-init on first call so static-load timing can't see a half-initialised
# ProjectSettings.

## True when `path` carries a codepoint that must never reach a filesystem API.
##
## Issue #889: the previous guard built its sentinel with `String.chr(0)`, and
## Godot emits `Unicode parsing error … Unexpected NUL character` while
## *constructing* that string. Every validated call — including reads that then
## failed with "File not found" — printed an alarming engine error that had
## nothing to do with the caller's path. Reading codepoints instead never
## materialises a NUL String, so the noise is gone.
##
## Both codepoints are rejected, for different reasons:
##   * `0x0000` — a real embedded NUL can truncate a C string, so the path that
##     is validated is not the path that gets opened. Current Godot cannot
##     retain one in a String, making this a no-op today; it stays as
##     defense-in-depth for any build or input path that can.
##   * `0xFFFD` — what current Godot actually substitutes for a NUL or any other
##     undecodable input. Once the engine has replaced the byte there is no way
##     left to tell an attempted NUL from malformed UTF-8 from a literal
##     replacement character, so the only safe reading at a security boundary is
##     to refuse all three. A legitimate filename containing U+FFFD is rejected
##     too; that false positive is deliberate and vanishingly rare.

## Returns "" when the path is a safe `res://`-rooted reference inside the
## project root. Returns a human-readable error message otherwise.
## Prefer `path_error` over calling this directly — it wraps the message in the
## canonical error code.
##
## Pass `for_write = true` for any handler that creates/overwrites the file
## (write_file, create_script, patch_script, ResourceSaver-backed saves,
## scene saves). Write callers additionally refuse the project manifest and
## startup override, plus the `.godot/` metadata dir. Reads default to
## `for_write = false`, which permits inspecting those files.

## Returns "" when `path` is safe to hand to `ResourceLoader.load` / `.exists`.

##     and the engine only ever resolves it to a resource already in the
##     project, so there is nothing to confine.
##   * `user://…` — the per-project user data dir, confined under its root the
##     same way `res://` is (so `user://../…` can't escape the sandbox).

## Refuse writes that would clobber project-critical files. The path is already
## confirmed `res://`-rooted and traversal-free by the caller.
##
## Comparisons are case-folded: macOS (APFS) and Windows (NTFS) are
## case-insensitive by default, so `res://Project.godot` resolves to the real
## `project.godot` and must be refused too.
##
## `.import` sidecars are deliberately NOT blocked — editing an asset's import
## options then re-importing is a legitimate, recoverable workflow (the file is
## source-controlled). The blocked set is the startup-execution surface only:
## the manifest, its `override.cfg` shadow, and the `.godot/` cache dir.
