## Executes a list of sub-commands through the dispatcher with stop-on-first-error
## semantics. When undo=true (default), any successful sub-commands are rolled
## back via the scene's UndoRedo history if a later sub-command fails.

## Commands that cannot run as batch sub-commands, each with the reason a batch
## can't host it.
## - batch_execute: would recurse.
## - reload_plugin: schedules teardown; later batch operations could pump
##   its callback while the batch handler is still executing.
## - run_tests: a batch executes synchronously inside one dispatcher tick with
##   NO transport servicing, so a full suite starves the WebSocket heartbeat
##   (the exact disconnect the serviced test_run path exists to prevent) and
##   the Python batch handler only allows 30s anyway — call the test_run tool
##   directly.
## - game_command: it is deferred — its reply flows out-of-band correlated by a
##   _request_id that dispatch_direct deliberately strips (see
##   McpDispatcher.dispatch_direct), so a game op nested in a batch would have
##   no completion channel and hang or lose its reply. input_sequence made this
##   concrete (#814); the whole game_command surface shares the deferred path.
