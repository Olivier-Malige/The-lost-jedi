## Godot AI MCP — game-process helper.
##
## Registered as an autoload by plugin.gd when the Godot AI plugin is enabled.
## Runs in the running game process (separate from the editor) so the plugin
## can request the game's framebuffer over the editor-debugger channel.
##
## The editor never has direct access to the game's pixels: even when "Embed
## Game Mode" is on, the game is still a separate OS child process whose
## window is reparented into the editor via Win32 SetParent / X11
## XReparentWindow / macOS remote layer (Godot PR godotengine/godot#99010).
## So viewport-texture capture on the editor side never contains game pixels.
## This autoload solves that by replying to "mcp:take_screenshot" debug
## messages with a PNG of Viewport.get_texture() from inside the game.
##
## No-ops in the editor (Engine.is_editor_hint) and silently sits idle
## when the debugger channel is inactive (e.g. exported release builds)
## — register_message_capture is safe to call either way, it's
## send_message that requires an active channel.

const CAPTURE_PREFIX := "mcp"
## Cap per-frame flush so a runaway print loop can't blow the debugger's
## packet budget in a single send. Surplus stays queued for the next frame.
const FLUSH_BATCH_LIMIT := 200
## How long take_screenshot waits for the game's first real presentation
## before reading the viewport texture back. The "mcp" capture registers in
## this autoload's _ready(), which runs BEFORE the main scene enters the tree
## and before the renderer has presented anything — so a request arriving
## right after mcp:hello would otherwise read back the clear-color
## framebuffer (observed as a uniform RGB(77,77,77) PNG on GitHub's
## GPU-less paravirtualized macOS runners, where the first present lags
## seconds behind boot). MUST stay below the editor-side reply timer
## (DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SEC = 8.0 in debugger/mcp_debugger_plugin.gd) so a
## game that genuinely can't render falls through to the existing
## texture/image error replies before the editor gives up with its
## generic timeout.

## #777: how long the main loop can go without ticking _process before
## _handle_take_screenshot treats it as frozen and commits a synchronous
## stale-frame capture instead of awaiting frames that will never come.
## A backgrounded/minimized play-in-editor game stops iterating its main
## loop entirely, so any real threshold works; 1s keeps a merely-slow game
## (heavy frame, low FPS) on the fresh-frame await path.
const MAIN_LOOP_STALL_MSEC := 1000
## How long frames_drawn can stay flat before _handle_take_screenshot treats
## rendering as suppressed and commits the synchronous stale-frame capture.
## On Windows, minimizing the game window freezes frame presentation but NOT
## the main loop — _process keeps ticking, so the MAIN_LOOP_STALL_MSEC beacon
## never trips and every capture used to burn the full FIRST_FRAME_WAIT_SEC
## await before replying stale (issue #794 smoke, item 1b). Larger than the
## loop threshold so a heavy-but-rendering game (~1 FPS frame gaps) stays on
## the fresh-frame await path; a sub-0.7 FPS game that trips this still gets
## an honestly stale-flagged image immediately instead of a 6s wait.

##
## Per-step round-trips can't hit a target frame — network jitter lands each
## input on whatever frame its reply happens to arrive on, so a jump arc or a
## timed combo is unreproducible (#814). input_sequence takes the whole
## timeline in one call and drives it game-side, applying each step's action on
## its scheduled frame, then replies once (deferred). Frame count (not ms) is
## the timing basis: it's what reproduces identically across runs.

## Hard caps mirrored by the server-side schema (see game handlers). The game
## side re-checks them so a malformed direct message can't park the coroutine
## on an unbounded await; the server rejects the same cases up front with a
## clearer error.
##
## The frame cap bounds the sequence in *frames*, which is a wall-clock time
## only at a given FPS: 600 frames is ~10s at 60fps but longer under load or on
## a throttled runner. It is not sized to the ~30s deferred budget
## (editor_handler.INPUT_SEQUENCE_TIMEOUT_SEC) — the two are independent
## safeguards. If a genuinely slow run exceeds the budget, the dispatcher
## returns a clean DEFERRED_TIMEOUT rather than hanging, so the cap can stay a
## simple frame count.

## --- game_eval: execute arbitrary GDScript in the running game ---

## Wall-clock ceiling for a single game_eval. Evaluated code that awaits
## something which never completes (a signal that never fires, a timer on a
## paused tree) would otherwise pin the request open until the dispatcher's
## 15s deferred budget / the server's 15s command timeout fires it as an
## opaque INTERNAL_ERROR — with the temp eval Node leaked into the tree.
## Bounding it here lets us free the node and reply with an actionable
## message instead. See hi-godot/godot-ai#487.
##
## TIMEOUT ORDERING — load-bearing across three files: this value MUST stay
## below the editor-side fallback timer in
## `debugger/mcp_debugger_plugin.gd::request_game_eval` (`timeout_sec`,
## default 10.0), which in turn stays below the dispatcher's `game_eval`
## budget in `dispatcher.gd` (15000 ms). So: game 8s < editor 10s <
## dispatcher 15s. Only this game-side guard emits the specific
## "Eval exceeded 8s" message (both it and the editor backstop now carry the
## EVAL_HUNG code, #518, but the editor's message can't name the cause).
## Raise this at/above the editor timer (or drop that timer below this) and
## the less specific editor message wins the race, silently losing the
## diagnostic this fix exists to provide. The cross-file contract is enforced
## by tests/unit/test_game_eval_timeout_ordering.py.
##
## NOTE: this catches a hung `await`, not a CPU-bound loop with no `await` —
## a tight `while true:` with no yield blocks the main thread, so nothing
## (including this poll) runs until it yields. That case is out of scope.
